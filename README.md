# sass-essentials

basic project with sass-essentials

sass-styles and scss-styles.scss shouldn't be at the same project at a time. instead, only one file extension should be used. both are shown here just to
compare both syntax and notation.

# to compile .scss and .sass files

run sass --watch scss-styles.scss styles.css
